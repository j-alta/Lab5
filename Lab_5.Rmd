***Question 1***
We don't want to  all students who are on probation with all students who are not on probation to evaluate this Universityâ€™s program because we are trying evaluate the potential causal impact of the probation policy on educational outcomes. To do so, we are employing a regression discontuinity design that examines educational outcomes of students who did and did not receive probation but are otherwise roughly the same in other characteristics. This requires us to only look at observations right around (ie, right above and below) the cutoff of the 1.60 GPA threshold that triggers a student receiving academic probation.

***Question 2***
The running variable is the student's GPA. The cutoff is whether that GPA is below or above 1.6.

```
***Question 7***
The p-value of the coefficient on above is less than 0.01, indicating it is statistically significant at the 99% level.

***Question 8***
The college's academic probation program is not very successful, judging from these analyses. Students right above the probation threshold actually had a higher rate of graduating on time about 4 percentage points more likely to do so than students just below the threshold. There is a chance that the difference in graduation on time rates may be due to chance, as evidenced by the lower signficance level that the relevant regression coefficient displayed to the other coefficients.
