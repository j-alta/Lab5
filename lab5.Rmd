***Question 1***
We don't want to  all students who are on probation with all students who are not on probation to evaluate this Universityâ€™s program because we are trying evaluate the potential causal impact of the probation policy on educational outcomes. To do so, we are employing a regression discontuinity design that examines educational outcomes of students who did and did not receive probation but are otherwise roughly the same in other characteristics. This requires us to only look at observations right around (ie, right above and below) the cutoff of the 1.60 GPA threshold that triggers a student receiving academic probation.

***Question 2***
The running variable is the student's GPA. The cutoff is whether that GPA is below or above 1.6.

#Question 3: Binned scatter plots and histograms for 2-3 predetermined characteristics compared with GPA cutoff 

#Create GPA cutoff variable and filtered dataset
df <- df |> 
      mutate(gpa_cutoff = GPA - 1.6)

df_narrow = df |> 
            filter(gpa_cutoff <= 1.2 & gpa_cutoff >= -1.2)

#There doesn't appear to be a spike in density along the cutoff, and predetermined characteristics appear to be similar on either side of the threshold.
